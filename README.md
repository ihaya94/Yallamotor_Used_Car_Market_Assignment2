The columns are listed below:

Using this dataset we have tried to answer the following questions:
Q#1. What are the majority of brand cars that are resold?
Q#2. What is the average price per model?
Q#3. What type of cars has the best/worst resale value?
Q#4. Does the color of the car affect its resale?
Q#5. Does the model of the car affect its resale?
Q#6. Is there a correlation between car model year and price?
